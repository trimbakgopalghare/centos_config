# Configuration file for CCpp hook

# CCpp hook writes its template to the "/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" file
# and stores the original template in the "/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern"
# file. If you want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
# the original template as well, set 'MakeCompatCore' to 'yes'.
# If the original template string starts with "|", the string "core" is used
# instead of the template.
# For more information about naming core dump files see 'man 5 core'.
MakeCompatCore = yes

# The option allows you to set limit for the core file size in MiB.
#
# This value is compared to value of the MaxCrashReportSize configuration
# option from (/etc/abrt.conf) and the lower value is used as the limit.
#
# If MaxCoreFileSize is 0 then the value of MaxCrashReportSize is the limit.
# If MaxCrashReportSize is 0 then the value of MaxCoreFileSize is the limit.
# If both values are 0 then the core file size is unlimited.
MaxCoreFileSize = 0

# Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
# (useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults)
